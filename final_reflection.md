## Final Reflection
This summer semester has been a trying time but also very informational. 
It took some adjusting to the class format and unlearning the idea of doing work for a grade vs. doing work to familiarize myself in the environment infinite concepts.
In many cases, I found myself understanding that there's more than one right answer, but it may not the right scenario. Right answer and right scenario, both arguments need to be true. 
I tried from the beginning to engage in classes and ask questions when unsure. I often felt inadequate in terms of subject knowledge but later found that I knew more than I did originally. 
The first two weeks were a little frustrating in terms of staying within the guidelines of the Programmer's Pact and making sure all tests passed.
By week 3-4 I started to maintain a rhythm and better understand what I was building and eventually became successful in passing the system tests.
I made a consistent effort to clean up my code, miniimize return methods, abide by the pact, and write more detailed notes.
I learned that strategy is just as or even more important than just knowing a bunch of commands. That's what makes the difference between computing minutes and seconds.
Due to my hectic schedule I often did not give myself a lot of days to review the code and make deeper refinements. I would often look at the code for a day or two
and make all of my commits on the day of submission.
It's not the best method, but time constraints only allowed for so much in this current season.
I faced a lot of syntax issues and declaration problems toward the beginning. Because I'm learning multiple coding languages, sometimes I fell short in coding fluent "Java-nese".
I was consistent in attending class and missed less than 5 meetings and a few times helped classmates who messaged me during zoom lessons about reading assignments.
## Final Grade Proposal
Based on the above, I propose A- as my final grade. I completed every assignment with effort/on time, engaged in reflection, and grew stronger in problem-solving, strategy, and recursion. I felt accomplished when all tests would pass with my given solutions and Iâ€™m proud of how far I've come and how much I understand now compared to weeks 1-2.
