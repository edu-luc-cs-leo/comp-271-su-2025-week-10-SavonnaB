## Week 09
For week 09 I noticed several differences between my code and the solution code.
The main differences were really on the execution level.
For example, I chose to divide the array using a merge function whereas the solution had left and right pointers similar to what we reviewed in class.
Though they have the same type of function and achieve similar results, I do need to work on not over complicating objectives.
Also, my recusion method included left >= right vs the solution left < right. This is a much simpler logic in my opinion than what I decided on.
Overall, the code was similar but the recursion logic was slightly different probably due to Prof. Leo having much more experience in simplifying logic than I do. 
I need to practice different types of recursion styles to refine code logic based on specific scenarios.
